# Tatter\Exports
Modular file exports, for CodeIgniter 4

## Quick Start

1. Install with Composer: `> composer require tatter/exports`
2. Export your files

## Features

## Installation

Install easily via Composer to take advantage of CodeIgniter 4's autoloading capabilities
and always be up-to-date:
* `> composer require tatter/exports`

Or, install manually by downloading the source files and adding the directory to
`app/Config/Autoload.php`.

## Configuration (optional)

The library's default behavior can be altered by extending its config file. Copy
**bin/Exports.php** to **app/Config/** and follow the instructions
in the comments. If no config file is found in **app/Config** the library will use its own.
